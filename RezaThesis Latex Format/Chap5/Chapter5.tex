\chapter{Conclusion and Future Plan}
This Thesis will be assessed the structure of research on effort and cost estimation models for web applications by examining the techniques that were castoff to shape approach, the datasets that will  castoff and the research types will be engaged. This will be done in the environment of promoting effort and cost estimation practices from traditional software development.

Although many revisions have been accompanied by effort estimation models for web applications, There is no strong suggestion that there is a certified method or a set of verified approaches for estimating the effort and cost of web applications. All of the performances will be used are tailored forms of systems taken from traditional software engineering.
